# Train_Fashion_MNIST_dataset
This is the way i started learning tensorflow, ENJOY ML!

Starting from the https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/  
Don't just copy paste the code during learning . Instead read about every word that you encounter, that you don't know.This way we explore the field of ML. There are several blogs written so well to enlighten you on those topic.

# For some of the questions that comes in our mind :

  1. what is google colab?
     https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-tensorflow-keras-pytorch.html 
     
  2. what is tensor flow? How to use it? 
     https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/
     
  3. how google colab is using GPUs & the TPU :

  6.   What is Adam? Why to use Adam?
       a good explaination on :
            https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/
       
       Research paper : "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization"
